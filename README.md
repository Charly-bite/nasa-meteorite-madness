#  Impactor-2025 - Meteorite Madness

## Hackatón GDL - NASA Challenge | Meteor Madness

A comprehensive interactive web platform that enables scientists, politicians, students, and citizens to simulate asteroid impacts using real NASA data and visualize their consequences in real-time. This project merges educational and scientific aspects, explaining complex astrophysical concepts through understandable infographics, narratives, and simulations without losing scientific accuracy.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, NASA and the USGS manage their data separately. NASA's NEO API provides data on asteroid size, velocity, and trajectory, while the USGS offers maps and data on seismic zones, elevations, and tsunami-prone regions. This separation complicates the ability to create clear simulations of asteroid impacts and their consequences. Impactor-2025 bridges this gap through interactive visualizations and a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎮 Real-Data Simulation
Users can simulate an asteroid's fall using real NASA data (size, speed, angle, trajectory). Interactive sliders allow adjustment of parameters like velocity or entry angle to see real-time consequences.

### 📊 Consequence Visualization
The tool shows the physical and environmental consequences of impacts in real-time, including:
- Crater size calculations
- Affected tsunami zones
- Atmospheric and local climate changes
- Population impact assessment
- Energy release measurements

### 🛡️ Mitigation Strategy Testing (Defend the Earth Mode)
